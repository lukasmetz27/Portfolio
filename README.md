## House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques - Kaggle

The goal of this project is to predict the house price depanding on many different features. At this project I orient myself to the CRISP-DM model. In the first step I read some article about real estate and the current situation, so I get a overview about the topic. After reading some articles I load the dataset and explore the data. I use different descriptive statistics and visualization to get a better overview about the data. A very time consuming but important part of the project was the data preparation. First of all I take care about the missing values and the outliers. Furthermore Scaling is a very important step to get better results. 
After the whole prepartion steps, I come to the exciting part of machine learning. So I chose different regression models and evalute them with der MAE. I use GridSearchCV for the fine tuning part. After comparing different models, I chose the best and analyse we it outperfomrs the other models. At the end I discuss further steps and summerized my results.

Steps of this project:
* Data Exploration / Data Understanding --> Data Visualization
* Data Prepreocessing
* Data Scaling
* Modeling 
* Evaluating
