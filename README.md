### Goal
* Evaluation of different Regression Models to predict the house prices 
** use individual models and stacking
* Chose and finetune the model

### Code and Resources used
* Python
* Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Missingno, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Data: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

### Outlook
* combine the dataset with another dataset -> getting more precise predictions
* Building a Neuronal Network 

# Project 2:
## [Crawl the ImmoNet Website and store the real estate data into a MySQL table](https://github.com/lukasmetz27/CrawlerImmoNet)

![](/images/data.jpg)

### Goal 
* Crawl real estate data from website "ImmoNet"
* Collect real-estate data like: Price, Square Meter, Number of Rooms, City, Date
* Store the data in relational database (MySql)
* After collecting the data, I want to investigate, manipulate and scale the data to predict real estate prices

### Code and Resources use
* Python
* Packages: Scrapy
* Data: [ImmoNet](https://www.immonet.de/)

### Outlook
* Install the crawler at a Raspberry Pi and crawl data once a day
*  Crawl further real estate sites like ImmoScout, Immowelt
* Store more data
* Predict the price with Machine Learnings methods
